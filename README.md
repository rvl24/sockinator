# sockinator
This is an application to produce custom sock patterns given the dimensions of your feet. The appropriate files live
[here](https://github.com/rvl24/sockinator), and the app is hosted on Heroku and can be viewed [here](https://sockinator.herokuapp.com/) (maybe, if I've got it working...). The app can also be `flask run`.
